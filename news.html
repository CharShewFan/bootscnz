      <p class="mt-5 container">Dr Bloomfield said the South Auckland family at the centre of the community outbreak were well aware of the gravity of what had happened and his priority remained eliminating the outbreak and ensuring people felt safe coming forward for testing.<br>

        "I can't imagine the stress that these people feel at the moment," he said. "In fact, I saw a story this morning that they 'feel the weight of the nation on their shoulders'. I think they have a good sense of the fact they didn't comply with what they should have been doing.<br>

        "I would be very reluctant to do anything that would actually deter people from coming forward and being tested. We need to actually all be in this together and people being tested is fundamental to us being able to respond effective."<br>

        He said it was widely accepted that taking a prosecutorial approach to the latest breaches would hinder people coming forward.<br>

        Dr Bloomfield must refer matters to police for a legal prosecution to proceed, but he told Morning Report he wasn't convinced this be a productive move.<br>

        "I was just need to be convinced that it was actually going to be a useful thing to do rather than a counter-productive thing to do and we've seen other commentators making the same point."
